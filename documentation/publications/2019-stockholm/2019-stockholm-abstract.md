The NLSY is a collection of three samples tracking individuals and their offspring for up to forty years.  Using explicit and implicit responses, we estimate the proportion of shared genes in each familial relationship. An example of an explicit item is "Do you share the same biological father?" An example of an implicit item is "How far away does your biological father live?" The dataset contains 30,000 people and 85,000 links. (Data collection 79 began in 1979 and has occurred every other year since, and 97 began in 97 and has been collected every other year since 1997. NLSY 79 gen1 and gen2 NLSY 97 gen1 ) The 97 was kind of a disappointment because most of the links are 0.5 or 0, in contrast the 79 contains a lot of half-siblings (0.25) which helped improve model estimation.  The 79 also has cross-generational links.  Conventional family with 2 gen1 sisters each with 2 gen 2 offspring, six choose 2 is 15, supports 15 links, but since the 97 has only 1 generation, 2 gen1 sisters produce only 1 link.  The NLSY links is an R package that serves 2-3 purposes.  with 3 components.  The first is it contains biometrical datasets 2) it contains functions that prepare conventional datasets for biometrical analysis, and 3) it contains   documentation and vignettes to help those without much experience with biometrical analysis or the NLSY.
