============================

**Consider moving or duplicating this to whatever public webpage we establish.**

2018-01-02 through 2018-01-07
-----------------
* updated NLSY variables through 2012.  Helped Gen2 ROC agreement between implicit & explicit.
    ```
        Version Agree Disagree
    1      86  7639      345
    2      85  7492      355
    ```

* [Issue #39](https://github.com/LiveOak/nlsy-links-determination-2017/issues/39):
    > `Process.tblOutcome` is no longer necessary.  But a lot of important processing occurs between the extracts and `Process.tblResponse`.  If an R script could replace `Response.cs`, other people could manage their own outcomes without having to deal with installing & configuring Visual Studio.
    >
    >We might create a version that avoids SQL Server too.  It probably would be slower, but maybe easier to start out with.  Especially if you have only a few items & variables.
