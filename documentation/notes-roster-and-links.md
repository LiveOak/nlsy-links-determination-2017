Documentation & Tutorials for NLSY97 Linking & Rosters
==============================

1. [Tutorial: Linking Roster Items Across Rounds in the NLSY97](https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/getting-started/intro-to-the-nls/tutorials/tutorial-linking-roster-items-across-rounds)

    > Objective:  Our goal is to link household roster items across survey rounds using unique household member ID codes provided in the NLSY97 data set. This tutorial explains how to find the same member of the respondent's household across different survey rounds in the NLSY97.

1. [Tutorial: Matching Cohabiting Partners to Their Characteristics in the NLSY97](https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/getting-started/intro-to-the-nls/tutorials/tutorial-matching-cohabiting-partners-their)

    > Objective:  To link the respondent's first cohabiting partner to the partner's characteristics using information from the created event history arrays, the household and non-resident rosters, and the partner roster. In particular, this tutorial shows you how to find the age of the respondent's first cohabiting partner in the NLSY97 data set.

1. [Introduction to the NLSY97 Sample](https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/nlsy97/intro-to-the-sample)

    > Description of the sample, the sample design and screening process, interview methods, retention and reason for non-interview, and confidentiality.


1. [Using and Understanding the Data](https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/nlsy97/using-and-understanding-the-data)

    > Information on survey instruments, variable types, the interviewing process, item nonresponse, sample weights and design effects, data documentation, and how to access the data.

1. [Index to the NLSY97 Cohort](https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/nlsy97)


1. [Tutorial: Constructing Comparable Samples across the NLSY79 and NLSY97](https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/getting-started/intro-to-the-nls/tutorials/tutorial-constructing-comparable-samples-across)

    > Objective: This tutorial walks you through the basic steps of constructing parallel samples for research projects that use both the NLSY79 and the NLSY97 cohorts. It then helps you create a similar variable--work status at age 20--for both cohorts.
    
1. [Tutorial: Linking NLSY79 Mothers and Their Children](https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/getting-started/intro-to-the-nls/tutorials/tutorial-linking-nlsy79-mothers-and-their)

    > Objective:  Our goal is to link NLSY79 mothers with their children.  This tutorial explains the general logic to link mothers and children of any age covered in the Children of the NLSY79.  The tutorial then gives a specific example of using data on mothers and young adult daughters by creating two variables:  (1) whether the mother had a first birth prior to age 18, and (2) whether the daughter had a first birth prior to age 18.  This allows one to examine intergenerational correlations in teenage childbearing.
